## How it works

Wokwi project using a D flip-flop ring to display "EFAB" on the 7-segment display.

## How to test
Works best with a slow clock (2~10Hz) or manually stepping with demo board's "step" button.
Tunr off all input switches, then power on the board. Expect to see "F" blinking on the display with each clock pulse.
